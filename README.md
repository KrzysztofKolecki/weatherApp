# Weather App

This repository combines both the mobile and backend components of a simple weather observation application. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Mobile App:** A React Native mobile application built with Expo, providing a user-friendly interface for checking weather conditions.

2. **Backend:** A Nest.js/Node.js backend that handles RESTful APIs, integrates with an external weather API, implements error handling and data validation, ensures secure communication, and incorporates caching to reduce API calls.

Please refer to the respective README files in the `mobile` and `backend` folders for detailed instructions on setting up and running each part of the project.
