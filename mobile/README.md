A simple mobile weather app developed with React Native and Expo.

## Features

- Search for weather information by the name of the city.
- Intuitive user interface.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Save favorite locations for quick weather checks.
- Simple caching mechanism.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed
- Expo CLI installed (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd mobile
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the Expo development server:

```bash
expo start --web
```

It's easiest to test on Web version as server is working on the same computer. It should also work in emulator, but wasn't tested that way.

4. Scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your mobile device or run on an emulator.
